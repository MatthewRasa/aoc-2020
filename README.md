# Advent of Code 2020

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges.

## Building
To build the challenge solutions:
```
make
```

To clean the build objects:
```
make clean
```

## Running

To run the challenge (either part 1 or part 2) for a specific day, the format is:
```
./bin/XX <1|2> < input/XX.txt
```

E.g. to run day 2, part 1:
```
./bin/02 1 < input/02.txt
```
